# Static 
**Static** is a simple static website builder based on **Haml**, **Sass**, and
**CoffeeScript**, instead of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **The first rule** of **Static** is you do not talk about **Static**.
- **The second rule** of **Static** is you DO NOT talk about **Static**!
- **The third rule** of **Static** is if someone yells "stop!", goes limp or taps out, the fight is over.
- **The fourth rule** of **Static** is only two guys to a fight.

## Static is Not so Static
**Static** is not so static after all.  With jQuery support for AJAX, sites
built with **Static** can be just as dynamic as any site.  **Static** actually
improves the construction of full feature web apps by completely separating
server logic from the design, layout and interactivity of the web pages.  

Using **Static** for web apps frees you to choose any backed technology, or even
rely completely on 3rd party APIs.
